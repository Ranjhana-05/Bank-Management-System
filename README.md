# Core Java Banking System

## Overview
This project is a console-based Banking Management System developed using Core Java. 
The application allows users to create multiple bank accounts and perform operations such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry through a menu-driven interface.

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate fundamental Java concepts including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Collections, and basic input validation. The system stores account data temporarily using ArrayList during program execution.

## Features
- Create new bank accounts
- Deposit money into an account
- Withdraw money with balance validation
- Check account balance
- Supports multiple accounts using ArrayList
- Menu-driven console interaction

## Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Constructors
- Collections (ArrayList)
- Loops and Switch Case
- Input Validation
- Method-based design (separation of logic and input handling)



2. Run the program:
   java BankDriver
